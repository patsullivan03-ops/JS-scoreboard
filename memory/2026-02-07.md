## NCAAB Scoreboard Project
- Pat requested a live college basketball scoreboard for a specific list of 24 games.
- Built a Python script `fetch_ncaab.py` that hits the ESPN Group 50 API to fetch Division I scores.
- The script filters for the tracked teams and generates `SCOREBOARD.md`.
- Attempted to push to `patsullivan03-ops/milo-scoreboard` but failed due to missing GitHub credentials.
- **Pending:** Need GitHub PAT or SSH key from Pat to enable automated pushes.
- **System Task:** Automated score updates are scheduled for 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM ET.

## Current Game Context
- Villanova @ Georgetown was tied 52-52 in the 2nd half during the last check.
- Marquee matchups for later today: Duke @ UNC, Illinois @ Michigan St, Houston @ BYU.
